## Step 1:
In demo/practice section, create a graph (only possible for practice section), or use the preset tree and select the start vertex and end vertex. The size of the preset tree can be varied using the Tree Depth control.
- **Start Vertex:** Initial state for the beginning of the algorithm.
- **End Vertex:** Goal state, reaching which the algorithm halts.
## Step 2:
-Click on the  **Start IDDFS** button to begin the experiment.
## Step 3:
View the central canvas and changes as you keep clicking the **Next** button. View the Instructions section for details about the controls. View the **Information** section for details about the algorithm.
